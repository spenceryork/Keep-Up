# Keep-Up

Keep-Up is in it's infacny stages. It is a budgeting project I started for my backend Capstone project at NSS. It allows users to track purchase for certain occasions to ensure they stay on budget.

Users can create occasions that may need a budget.

Users can also track Purchases and link a Purchase to a particular Occasion.

They can then review their budget against what they have spent for their Occasion.
